# Bus-Arrival-Time-Prediction

In this study, we utilized the "New York City Bus Data" from Kaggle. This repository includes a Jupyter notebook detailing data processing steps and feature extraction from the dataset, along with the implementation of a fully connected neural network for bus arrival time prediction.
